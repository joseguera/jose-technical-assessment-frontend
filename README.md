# Things that can be implemented

## Refactor the code. There's a bit of redundancy in the components. I feel like I could've componentize more often

## I still needed to calculate all of the totals on the Bag page

## I wanted to implement a remove item function
## The styiling needs more work/fine-tuning

## I wish I could've implemented some state management such as Redux in order to help with the redundancy mentioned above

## Overall, I really enjoyed this challenge. It truly deepened my knowledge and allowed to think of problems in a different way.
## I'm actually going to finish this challenge on my own, just for fun. I wish I had more time to finish the whole thing for you.

## Thanks for the opportunity.
